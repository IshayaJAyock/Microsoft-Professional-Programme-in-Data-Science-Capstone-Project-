# Introduction

The core business of almost every financial institution is the distribution of loans. This means a significant portion of the profits that flow into these organizations come from interests that accrue on these loans. Hence one of the most principal objectives of financial institutions is to ensure that these loans are delivered into trusted hands. Today many financial institutions approve loans after a rigorous process of verification and validation. However, cases of bad debt are still a major concern for these organizations. This situation can be improved with the employment of data science. With available data, we can predict whether a particular applicant is a good fit for a loan by relying solely on machine learning techniques. The problem addressed is a classification problem. In a classification problem, we have to predict discrete values based on a given set of independent variables(s).

# Hypothesis

Hypothesis is a very important stage in any machine learning/data science pipeline. It involves understanding the problem statement in detail by brainstorming as many factors as possible which can impact the outcome. It is always done by understanding the problem statement thoroughly before looking at the data. Below are some of the factors likely to affect the Loan Approval (these factors are the dependent variables for this loan prediction problem).

1.Applicant Income: Applicants with high income have more chances of loan approval than those with low income.

2.Loan amount: Loan approval should also depend on the loan amount. If the loan amount is less, chances of loan approval should be high.

3.State code: The location of the applicant could affect the approval of loan. Applicants living in states with high average incomes have higher chances of loan approval compared to those living in states with low average incomes.

# Executive Summary

In this report, we present an analysis of data concerning credit scoring. This analysis is based on the Mortgage approvals data from the government. it consists of 500,000 observations of loan data with each containing specific characteristics of an individual loan applicant and the decision been made for approval. Exploratory data analysis was carried out by calculating summary and or descriptive statistics of the numeral columns in the data set. In the Exploration of the data, several potential relationships between the loan characteristics and the accepted rate were also identified. A predictive model was built to classify a customer as eligible or not eligible for loan. Based on the exploratory data analysis, there are many factors that could affect loan approval and some of the significant features found in the given dataset are as follows. 

* lender
* loan purpose
* state code
* Applicant Income
* Msa_md etc.....
