#Introduction
The core business of almost every financial institution is the distribution of loans. This means
a significant portion of the profits that flow into these organizations come from interests that
accrue on these loans. Hence one of the most principal objectives of financial institutions is
to ensure that these loans are delivered into trusted hands.
Today many financial institutions approve loans after a rigorous process of verification and
validation. However, cases of bad debt are still a major concern for these organizations. This
situation can be improved with the employment of data science.
With available data, we can predict whether a particular applicant is a good fit for a loan
by relying solely on machine learning techniques. The problem addressed is a classification
problem. In a classification problem, we have to predict discrete values based on a given set
of independent variables(s).
